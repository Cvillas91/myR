# Project  #2: 
#
# Details:
#  
# 1. Return to the dataset and computations you made for homework #9.
# 2. Expand the boxplot data you calculated (for each player's performance) so that you're 
# running those calculations for every player on every team.
# 3. Given each player's individual performance history, create a model for predicting each team's overall 
# (sum total) likely performance in any given game/matchup. This data should also take the form of boxplot metrics.
# 4. Create a new table that matches every team against every other team, and calculates the 
# likelyhood of each team's winning each matchup.
# 5. Assume for the sake of this exercise that a given "season" for your sport involves 20 random 
# matchups for each team. Predict which team(s) will have won the most matchups by the end of the season.
# 6. Calculate the individual likelyhood that each team will have won the most matchups during the season.
